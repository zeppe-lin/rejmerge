REJMERGE(8)

# NAME

rejmerge - merge files that were rejected during package upgrades

# SYNOPSIS

*rejmerge* [*-hnv*] [*-c* _conffile_] [*-r* _rootdir_]

# DESCRIPTION

*rejmerge* is a package management utility, which merges files that
were rejected during package upgrades.

For each rejected file found in _/var/lib/pkg/rejected/_, *rejmerge*
will display difference between installed version and the rejected
version.  The user can the choose to keep the installed version,
upgrade to the rejected or perform a merge of the two.

The options are as follows:

*-c* _conffile_, *--config*=_conffile_
	Specify an alternate configuration file instead of the default
	_/etc/rejmerge.conf_.

*-n*, *--dry-run*
	Print the differences between an installed version and
	rejected one, but do not execute any actions.

*-r* _rootdir_, *--root*=_rootdir_
	Specify an alternate root directory instead of the default
	'*/*'.  This should be used if you want to merge rejected
	files on a temporary mounted partition, which is "owned" by
	another system.

*-v*, *--version*
	Print version and exit.

*-h*, *--help*
	Print help and exit.

# ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables affect the execution of
*rejmerge*:

*EDITOR*
	The editor to use instead of *vi*(1).
*PAGER*
	The pager to use instead of *more*(1).
*TMPDIR*
	Directory in which to place temporary files.  If unset or set
	but unavailable, _/tmp_ is used.

*Important*:
	All the above variables may be overridden in
	_/etc/rejmerge.conf_.

# FILES

_/etc/rejmerge.conf_
	Default *rejmerge* configuration file.

_/var/lib/pkg/rejected/_
	Directory where rejected files are stored.

# EXIT STATUS

*0*    No error occurred.++
*>0*   Generic error code.++
*126*  Command invoked cannot execute.++
*130*  Script interrupted or terminated by *C-c*.

# BUGS

While only root can merge system files, the *-n*/*--dry-run* option
allows running *rejmerge* as a regular user to view the differences
between installed and rejected files without making any changes.

Note that you may encounter the situation when the rejected file has
very strict permissions (e.g., 0400) that prohibit regular users from
reading its content.  For example:

```
$ PAGER=cat rejmerge -n
diff: /var/lib/pkg/rejected/etc/tor/torrc: Permission denied
=======> /etc/tor/torrc
=======> [K]eep [U]pgrade [M]erge [D]iff [S]kip?
```

Just run *rejmerge -n* as root if you still want to view the diffs
without executing any actions.

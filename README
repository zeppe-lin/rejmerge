This directory contains rejmerge, a package management utility that
helps to merge files that were rejected during package upgrades.

It is a fork of CRUX' rejmerge utility (which is a part of CRUX'
pkgutils).  It was rewritten in POSIX shell with support of the
suckless' sbase utilities.  The original sources can be downloaded
from:

  1. https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=tools/pkgutils.git;a=summary
  2. git://crux.nu/tools/pkgutils.git

The actual dependencies are: sh(1), sbase or coreutils, diffutils and
pod2man(1pm).

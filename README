ABOUT

    This directory contains rejmerge, a package management utility that
    helps you merge files that were rejected during package upgrades.

    This is a fork of CRUX' rejmerge (which is a part of pkgutils). It
    was rewritten in POSIX shell with support of suckless core.
    The original sources can be downloaded from:

.SH NAME
rejmerge.conf \- configuration file for rejmerge(8)

.SH DESCRIPTION
When \fBrejmerge\fP is started it will source \fI/etc/rejmerge.conf\fP.
This file can be used to alter the way \fBrejmerge\fP displays file
differences and performs file merges. Changing the default behaviour is
done by re-defining the shell functions \fBrejmerge_diff()\fP,
\fBrejmerge_merge()\fP and/or shell variables \fBEDITOR\fP, \fBPAGER\fP.
.TP
.B rejmerge_diff()
This function is executed once for each rejected file.
Arguments \fB$1\fP and \fB$2\fP contain the paths to the installed and
rejected files. Argument \fB$3\fP contains the path to a temporary file
where this function should write its result. The contents of the
temporary file will later be presented to the user as the difference
between the two files.
.TP
.B rejmerge_merge()
This function is executed when the user chooses to merge two files.
Arguments \fB$1\fP and \fB$2\fP contain the paths to the installed and
rejected files. Argument \fB$3\fP contains the path to a temporary file

This function also has the option to set the variable
\fB$REJMERGE_MERGE_INFO\fP. The contents of this variable will be
displayed as informational text after a merge has been performed.
Its purpose is to provide information about the merge,
